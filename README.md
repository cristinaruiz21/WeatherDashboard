# WeatherDashboard
User Story: As a trveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

Purpose: To generate weather information for any city in the world. This information includes the temperature, wind speed, UV index, and humidity. There is a current day forecast as well as a 5-day forecast. 

Features: The UV index is color-coded by the safeness of the UV rays; green = safe, orange = warning, red = dangerous. When you search for a city, the city is then listed under the search bar. If you wish to look at that city's information again, simply click on its name in the search history.

Things I learned: I learned how to use API keys in order to connect an external database to my website. I also learned how to use Moment.JS to code for future dates.
